# Reasoning behind this new site

I decided that creating a separate site for this experimentation made the most sense.
Although I have a personal blog that I maintain, it is currently in development and I knew that I would get side tracked if I started adding to that site.
My personal blog also sees very little traffic so there is little to no benefit in installing trackers on there.

# Choosing a framework

I have experience with several website development frameworks including [Python Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) and, my choice for this blog, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll was my choice here as I wanted something I could set up in a few minutes so that I could get started on implementing trackers. I also knew I could easily host a Jekyll blog on Gitlab or GitHub pages under my domain.

# Posts on the site

Since you are reading this, you may already have worked the following out.
I have decided to document my experimentation on this blog as I go. 
That way I have a record of everything I have done including the good, bad and ugly bits of my journey.
